# Welcome to my Dotfiles

This is a collection of my basic config files for my _PopOS_ env, created with a bare git repo that auto-tracks my files (idea from [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles))

I'll always be adding more stuff

# Contents:

1. setup.sh _(work in proggress)_ with automated installation.
2. .zshrc with my preferred aliases.
3. vscode config/settings/snippets

# Setup

Just run

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PedroMarquetti/cfg_files/master/.local/bin/setup.sh | bash
```

For an automated setup...

Or you could

```
git clone https://github.com/PedroMarquetti/cfg_files.git
```

And copy files manually
