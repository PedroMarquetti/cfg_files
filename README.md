# Welcome to my Dotfiles
This is a collection of my basic config files for my PopOS env, created with a bare git repo that auto-tracks my files (idea from [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)

I'll always be adding more stuff 

# Contents:
1. setup.sh *(coming soon)* with automated installation.
2. .zshrc with my preferred aliases.
3. vscode config/settings/snippets
